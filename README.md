1. Ricos pizzeria, pizza ordering pizza code

   The code allows you to order any number of pizzas, and automatically calculates HST

   To make this work, I had to use multiple lists and loops inside loops, and if statements

2. 3 by 3 Minesweeper grid validator

   If you know Minesweeper, this code checks if the number in the middle of the grid matches the number of bombs in the grid. In the code, (-1) represents the bombs

      For this one, I used def, if statements, and loops to create this validator

3. Random App
   An app with 4 different functions(This was my favorite project to work on, also my most frustrating

   I used a lot of booleans like(if, else, elif, not, and, and or) to create validators for falsy inputs
   I also used multiple lists to store information for further use
   and math importations

   It's exactly what it sounds like

5. Travel Guide

   a travel guide website in Italy

   I used CSS, JavaScript, and HTML

   TG

6. Loop A

   This is a loop of the letter A in right-angle triangle formation(this may sound dumb, but I am incredibly proud of this code; it's the simpler things in life that truly matter)

   I used a simple while loop that went around 6 times
